      "Lattice is a holographic projection framework. Using three Kinect cameras, we capture RGB-D maps that our client software converts into 3D point clouds using the cameras' intrinsic parameters. Each point cloud is colorized with corresponding RGB data and streamed to the server, where multi-sensor calibration is performed using Iterative Closest Point and convex hull enclosure. This process computes the rigid transformations needed to align all point clouds within a common coordinate frame, accounting for each camera's position and orientation to maintain geometric consistency across views.",
      "During live capture, the server synchronizes timestamps, applies these calibration transforms in real time, and fuses overlapping regions through spatial filtering and averaging. The result is a smooth, fully aligned 3D reconstruction that can be visualized instantly and streamed to the HoloLens for real-time telepresence.",

      "*Inspired by the Spooky Spikes Minigame from Pummel Party*\n\nUsing TensorFlow and Keras, I implemented a streamlined reinforcement learning pipeline. The AI is trained using a Deep Q-Network (DQN) that considers the player's current state, the position of upcoming obstacles, and timing. The training process includes a replay buffer with 100,000 randomly sampled experiences, from which the model learns over 20,000 gradient update steps. The learning was stabilized through extensive tuning of hyperparameters, including epsilon decay rates, network architecture, and node density. Various configurations were tested to find the most stable and efficient setup for consistent learning performance.",
